Python assertions
	a = 3
	b = 3
	assert a = b
if true, nothing happens
if false, get an error

atom1 = [0,0,0]
atom2 = [0,0,1]
assert geometry_anaylsis.calculate_distance(atom1, atom2) == 1

if true, nothing happens
if false, get an error

pytest is a testing framework
	- test each python function in our script
	- unit test
install pytest
	conda install pytest-cov

1. create a new file
	- must start with test
	- must be saved in the directory with the python script
2. create a test function
	- must start with test
	- import function to be tested
	- assert answer
3. run pytest by typing pytest and hitting enter in terminal

pytest is running the test functions, and raises an error if something is unexpected
pytest -v gives the name of the test and whether it passed or failed

pytest has a lot of features
	- can test exceptions and errors
