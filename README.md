Materials for the MolSSI workshop at SETCA 2019.

## Geometry Analysis Project

Contains files to calculate the distance between two atoms. Two functions are used, one to calculate the distance and the other to determine if the distance is a bond. Also contains test files to use with pytest.

## Workshop Files

Five Jupyter notebooks that were created throughout the MolSSI workshop to learn how to use Python.

## Data Files

The data files were used in conjuction with the Jupyter notebooks.
